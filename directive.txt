Main description

The goal is to pull up a map with directions from one stop to the next, provide pictures images and video of the location, and scroll down to get to the next location. Each “page” (as in view window of the browser) should be a destination
When the user scrolls up to see their previous destinations show them as much info as they could want. Arrow keys should scroll on desktop. Swiping should scroll on mobile.
I want the image galleries to extend off to the right if theres enough content. Somehow mix content between images and youtube vids and maps. Have a way to scroll through the content without leaving or changing the site.

In the end you have a road trip that scrolls like its already been completed, just with impersonal images and videos

Save the road trip to a database and be able to see all the road trips in snippets, select them and view the awesome road trips other people have planned
Description of service used in MVP form:

Enter start location - IE Portland OR
Show map focused on that location
Enter first stop, or destination - IE Multnomah Falls
Show map with travel distance, time. Show pictures and video.
Ask for other destinations, upon entry scroll the page down and show more content.
Keep getting destinations until the user clicks on the end button, at which time they will be asked to provide a name for the road trip.
